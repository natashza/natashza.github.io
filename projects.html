    <h2>Here are some of my projects!</h2>
    <a class="project-link" href="https://github.com/TravisN959/Rally">Rally Project</a>
    <p>This project was one I did in collaboration with a fellow
      peer. This was our submission for the 2021 UCI ICSSC Jam for Change
      mini hackathon, in which we won first place. Click on the link
      above to access the GitHub repository for it and read more about it!</p>

    <p>For this project I teamed up with other peers to redesign the 
        site our school uses for class registration. The wireframes, high-
        fidelity prototypes and overall UI designs were all done using 
        Figma.</p>

    <a class="project-link" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yh2xMnCZHMiSRHiP9yR42xigXbvG4g9f?usp=sharing">Simulton Game Project</a>
    <p>This project consisted of a little game in which there are different 
      types of sprites, all performing different actions depending on their size, 
      color, and speed. The game was all written in python using the Eclipse IDE. 
      Above is a link to the python files that went into it.
